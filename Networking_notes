To check which process is running on port 80 --- sudo lsof -i :80   ()
To remove all the stopped container --- docker container prune

All running process - top 
All running processes in container - docker top conatinerID
docker inspect gives detailed container information in JSON format.
docker stats is container metrics in streaming way.

By default each container connected to each other with BRIDGE network.

              Container:80
NAT is configured on docker engine that is running on host.

Key points you've correctly identified:

docker0 is created at Docker Engine startup
Acts as a virtual network switch/interface
Manages inter-container communication
Handles NAT rules for port mappings (-p)
Serves as the gateway for container networking

............................
# check my ip - 
ifconfig = local/private IP  (en0)
curl ifconfig.me = public ip 
............................

We have normally 1 docker0 NI but ideally we should have network for each APPLICATION,S RESOURCES sepertely. we can do that like this - 
docker network create app1-network
docker run --network app1-network --name app1-web nginx
we can check the port of container - docker container port contaner_name
check IP of container - docker container inspect --format '{{ .NetworkSettings.IPAddress }}' webhost

we can connect or disconnect a live running container from specific network - 
docker network connect network_name container_name


we can list all docker network - docker network ls 
we can have container using host network rather than docker network using  --- --network host 
check my host ip - ifconfig en0

we can see which container is associated with which network -
docker inspect network_name


--------------------------------
DNS - 
--net-alias alias_name , when we launch containers in this way then essentially its like lb for those 2 containers and when we hit this alias name, then it will resolve in either of those containers.
