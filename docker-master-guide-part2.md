# Part 2: Building and Optimization

## Chapter 4: Dockerfile Mastery (The Construction Manual)

### 4.1 Understanding Dockerfile Instructions

#### Visual Memory Hook: "The Building Blueprint"
```
Foundation (FROM)
     ↓
Blueprint Room (WORKDIR)
     ↓
Add Tools (RUN)
     ↓
Add Materials (COPY/ADD)
     ↓
Setup Environment (ENV)
     ↓
Opening (EXPOSE)
     ↓
Start Command (CMD)
```

#### Memory Trick: "FORCE" - Fundamental Operations Required for Container Excellence
- **F**ROM: Choose base image
- **O**PERATIONS: RUN commands
- **R**ESOURCES: COPY/ADD files
- **C**ONFIGURATION: ENV and ARG
- **E**XECUTION: CMD and ENTRYPOINT

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\
Instruction	Purpose	When it Happens	Example - 
FROM	Defines the base image for the container.	Happens at the start of the build process.	FROM ubuntu:20.04

WORKDIR	Sets the working directory inside the container.	During the build process, before any other instructions that require a directory.	WORKDIR /app

COPY/ADD	Copies files from the host machine to the container.	During the build process.	COPY ./myapp /app

ENV	Sets environment variables inside the container.	During the build process.	ENV APP_ENV=production

EXPOSE	Documents which ports the container will listen on.	During the build process.	EXPOSE 80

CMD	Defines the default command to run when the container starts.	When the container is run (i.e., at runtime).	CMD ["python", "app.py"]
\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

### 4.2 Practical Dockerfile Creation

#### Basic Example: Python Web Application
```dockerfile
# Base Image Selection
FROM python:3.9-slim

# Working Directory
WORKDIR /app

# Memory Hook: "COPY First, RUN Later"
COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

# Configuration
ENV PORT=5000

# External Access
EXPOSE 5000

# Launch Command
CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

#### Exercise 4.2.1: Build Your First Application
Task: Create a simple Flask application with proper Dockerfile

Steps:
```python
# app.py
from flask import Flask
app = Flask(__name__)

@app.route('/')
def hello():
    return "Hello Docker World!"

if __name__ == '__main__':
    app.run(host='0.0.0.0')
```

```dockerfile
# Dockerfile
FROM python:3.9-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install -r requirements.txt

COPY . .
EXPOSE 5000

CMD ["python", "app.py"]
```

#### Memory Validation Quiz:
Q1: Why do we COPY requirements.txt before the rest of the files?
A1: Optimize cache usage - dependencies change less frequently than code

### 4.3 Advanced Dockerfile Techniques

#### Visual Memory Hook: "The Advanced Builder's Toolkit"
```
Base Tools (ARG)
    ↓
Health Checks
    ↓
User Permissions
    ↓
Volume Management
    ↓
Entrypoint Scripts
```

#### Advanced Example: Production-Ready Application
```dockerfile
# Build arguments
ARG NODE_VERSION=16

# Base image with version from argument
FROM node:${NODE_VERSION}-slim

# Create non-root user
RUN groupadd -r appgroup && \
    useradd -r -g appgroup appuser

# Set working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm ci --only=production

# Copy application
COPY --chown=appuser:appgroup . .

# Configure environment
ENV NODE_ENV=production \
    PORT=3000

# Expose port
EXPOSE 3000

# Health check
HEALTHCHECK --interval=30s --timeout=3s \
    CMD wget --spider http://localhost:3000/health || exit 1

# Switch to non-root user
USER appuser

# Start application
CMD ["node", "server.js"]
```

## Chapter 5: Multi-stage Builds (The Assembly Line)

### 5.1 Understanding Multi-stage Builds

#### Visual Memory Hook: "The Car Factory"
```
Raw Materials → Parts Factory → Assembly → Showroom
   (Source)     (Build Stage)   (Package)  (Final)
```

#### Memory Trick: "BUILD" Process
- **B**ase stage setup
- **U**se necessary tools
- **I**nclude only needed files
- **L**eave behind build tools
- **D**eploy minimal image

### 5.2 Practical Multi-stage Examples

#### Example 1: React Application
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build environment
FROM node:16 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Production environment
FROM nginx:alpine
COPY --from=builder /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html
EXPOSE 80
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
```

#### Exercise 5.2.1: Convert Single-stage to Multi-stage
Task: Convert a Java application build

Before:
```dockerfile
FROM openjdk:11
COPY . /app
WORKDIR /app
RUN ./mvnw package
CMD ["java", "-jar", "target/app.jar"]
```

After:
```dockerfile
# Stage 1: Build
FROM maven:3.8-openjdk-11 AS builder
WORKDIR /app
COPY pom.xml .
COPY src ./src
RUN mvn package -DskipTests

# Stage 2: Run
FROM openjdk:11-jre-slim
COPY --from=builder /app/target/*.jar app.jar
CMD ["java", "-jar", "app.jar"]
```

### 5.3 Optimization Techniques

#### Visual Memory Hook: "The Weight Loss Program"
```
Remove Build Tools → Minimize Layers → Use .dockerignore → Compress Final Image
```

#### Best Practices Memory Trick: "SLIM"
- **S**mall base images
- **L**ayers combined when possible
- **I**gnore unnecessary files
- **M**ulti-stage when appropriate

## Chapter 6: Docker Compose (The Orchestra Conductor)

### 6.1 Understanding Docker Compose

#### Visual Memory Hook: "The Symphony Orchestra"
```
Composer File (Score)
      ↓
Services (Musicians)
      ↓
Networks (Stage Layout)
      ↓
Volumes (Music Sheets)
```

### 6.2 Basic Compose File Structure

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  web:
    build: ./web
    ports:
      - "80:80"
    depends_on:
      - api
      
  api:
    build: ./api
    environment:
      - DB_HOST=db
    depends_on:
      - db
      
  db:
    image: postgres:13
    volumes:
      - db-data:/var/lib/postgresql/data

volumes:
  db-data:
```
