# Step 1: Use the official Node.js image as the base image for building
FROM node:18 AS build

# Step 2: Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the package.json and package-lock.json files to the container
COPY package*.json ./

# Step 4: Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Step 5: Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the React application for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 7: Use the official NGINX image for serving the built React app
FROM nginx:1.21

# Step 8: Copy the built app from the previous stage to NGINX's default public directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Step 9: Expose the port NGINX will use
EXPOSE 80

# Step 10: Command to start NGINX
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
..........this way this command "nginx" will run on foreground with daemon off............
