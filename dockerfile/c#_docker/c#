# Step 1: Use the official .NET SDK image as the base image for building
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:6.0 AS build

# Step 2: Set the working directory
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the project file and restore dependencies
COPY ["ElectronicsMicroservice/ElectronicsMicroservice.csproj", "./"] 
#Take the ElectronicsMicroservice.csproj file from the ElectronicsMicroservice folder and copy it to my current working directory (/app)

RUN dotnet restore "ElectronicsMicroservice.csproj"     # download all needed packages

# Step 4: Copy the rest of the application code
COPY . .

# Step 5: Build the application
RUN dotnet build "ElectronicsMicroservice.csproj" -c Release -o /app/build

# explanation - 
RUN dotnet build "ElectronicsMicroservice.csproj"
We need to specify the .csproj file because you might have multiple projects in your solution
The compiler needs to know which specific project to build

-c Release
We specify Release mode even though it's lighter because:
Debug is actually the default mode if not specified
You definitely don't want debug symbols and debugging info in production
Being explicit about Release mode is a best practice in Dockerfiles

-o /app/build
Specifies where to put the compiled output
We need this because:

Docker needs a clear, specific path to find the files for the next steps
Later, the publish command will look for these built files
Keeps our container organized with clear locations for build artifacts

- Release mode:
Smaller image size (no debug symbols)
Better performance
Optimized code
Takes less memory when running

- Debug mode:
Larger image size
Extra debugging information
Additional checking and validation
Takes more memory when running

So even though you get a Docker image either way, the content and performance of the containerized application will be different. When this container runs in production:

A Release build will run faster and use less resources
A Debug build would waste resources with unnecessary debug information

Think of it like packing a suitcase:

Release is like packing just what you need
Debug is like packing extra stuff "just in case" - but you don't need that in production!

So even though some parts might seem obvious (like Release mode), being explicit in Dockerfiles prevents confusion and potential issues later!

# Step 6: Publish the application
RUN dotnet publish "ElectronicsMicroservice.csproj" -c Release -o /app/publish
....... - c Release means build at prod level and save artifact in publish .........
dotnet build (output in /app/build):
Just compiles your code
Creates intermediate files
Doesn't include everything needed to run the app
Think of it as "getting everything ready"

dotnet publish (output in /app/publish):
Takes the build output
Adds all required runtime dependencies
Creates a complete, deployable package
Think of it as "packing everything for shipping"

# Step 7: Set the base image for runtime (this contains only the runtime, not SDK)   ////runtime stage
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:6.0
- first image was for build and now we have artifacts alreadys, so i use runtime image that is needed for run as its smaller and will do the job.

# Step 8: Set the working directory for the runtime image
WORKDIR /app

# Step 9: Copy the published app files from the build stage
COPY --from=build /app/publish .
.......... from build stage copy publish file (publish dir has artifact) and paste in current dir.............

# Step 10: Set environment variables (for example: environment and database connection string)
ENV ASPNETCORE_ENVIRONMENT=Production
ENV CONNECTION_STRING="your-connection-string-here"  # this has username and password all details, so db can connect to my app.

# Step 11: Expose the port the app will use
EXPOSE 80

# Step 12: Define the command to run the application when the container starts
CMD ["dotnet", "ElectronicsMicroservice.dll"]

.csproj - how project should be build, including dependencies, how app should be packaged.
.cs - its a source code and its used in buid process.
.dll - when .cs + .csproj in build stage then i get arifact in publish with .dll extension.

Why copy only .csproj first?
The .csproj file contains the project structure and dependencies for your .NET application. When you run dotnet restore, it reads the .csproj file and downloads all the required NuGet packages (dependencies) specified in that file. These dependencies are stored in the NuGet cache within the Docker image.
Benefit: By copying only the .csproj file and running dotnet restore, you allow Docker to cache this layer effectively. If only the source code changes (not the project file or dependencies), Docker will reuse the dotnet restore layer from the cache, avoiding re-downloading the dependencies.

''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''''
Why Can't You Just Copy the Remaining Files After dotnet restore?
The key reason is that the .csproj file and all source files are tightly connected during the build process. Here's a deeper explanation:

The .csproj File and Its Role in the Build Process
The .csproj file not only lists the dependencies (like NuGet packages) but also includes information about the files and resources that are part of your project. This means it defines how the project is built, what files to include, and how those files are referenced.

When you dotnet restore, it doesn't just download dependencies—it also prepares the build environment by resolving references to your source code and resources as defined in the .csproj file.

Build Dependencies and Source Files
When you run dotnet build or dotnet publish, the build process is looking for all the source files that are part of the project (i.e., the .cs files, configuration files, etc.) as well as the dependencies (which were restored earlier).

If you don’t copy all the files after restoring dependencies, Docker won’t have access to the actual code files during the build process. The reason for this is that dotnet build or dotnet publish needs to reference the source code that exists in the project directory in order to compile everything.
