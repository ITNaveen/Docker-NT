# Step 1: Use Node.js official image to build the React app
FROM node:18 AS build

# Step 2: Set the working directory for your React app
WORKDIR /app

# Step 3: Copy the package.json and package-lock.json (or yarn.lock) and install dependencies
COPY package*.json ./

# Step 4: Install dependencies
RUN npm install

# Step 5: Copy the rest of the React project files to the container
COPY . .

# Step 6: Build the React app for production
RUN npm run build

# Step 7: Use a lightweight web server to serve the static files (nginx)
FROM nginx:alpine

# Step 8: Copy the build files from the previous stage
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Step 9: Expose the port on which the server will run
EXPOSE 80

# Step 10: Start the Nginx server
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
