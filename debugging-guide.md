## Common Issues

### 1. Network Connectivity Problems

Network connectivity issues are among the most frequent problems developers encounter. Understanding common patterns can significantly speed up resolution time.

#### Key Indicators
- Connection timeouts
- DNS resolution failures
- Partial connectivity
- Intermittent connection drops
- SSL/TLS handshake failures

#### Investigation Steps
1. Verify basic connectivity (ping, traceroute)
2. Check DNS resolution
3. Review firewall settings
4. Inspect SSL certificates
5. Analyze network logs

#### Prevention Strategies
- Implement connection pooling
- Use circuit breakers
- Configure proper timeouts
- Monitor network metrics
- Maintain updated SSL certificates

### 2. Performance Degradation

Performance issues can be particularly challenging due to their often gradual onset and multiple contributing factors.

#### Common Symptoms
- Increased response times
- High CPU usage
- Memory leaks
- Disk I/O bottlenecks
- Database connection exhaustion

#### Investigation Approach
1. Gather performance metrics
2. Analyze system resources
3. Review application logs
4. Profile code execution
5. Monitor database performance

#### Mitigation Techniques
- Implement caching strategies
- Optimize database queries
- Configure connection pooling
- Use asynchronous processing
- Scale resources appropriately

### 3. Memory-Related Issues

Memory problems can be subtle and require systematic investigation approaches.

#### Types of Memory Issues
- Memory leaks
- Memory fragmentation
- Stack overflow
- Heap corruption
- Out of memory errors

#### Detection Methods
1. Memory profiling
2. Heap dumps analysis
3. Resource monitoring
4. Log pattern analysis
5. Performance counters

## Solution Patterns

### 1. Systematic Debugging Approach

A structured approach to debugging increases efficiency and success rate.

#### The Scientific Method in Debugging
1. **Observe** the problem
   - Collect error messages
   - Document symptoms
   - Note environmental factors
   - Record timing and frequency

2. **Form Hypothesis**
   - Analyze available data
   - Consider similar past issues
   - Review recent changes
   - Identify potential causes

3. **Test Hypothesis**
   - Create reproducible test cases
   - Isolate variables
   - Verify assumptions
   - Document results

4. **Draw Conclusions**
   - Analyze test results
   - Verify root cause
   - Document findings
   - Implement solution

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

Understanding the fundamental cause of issues prevents recurrence and improves system reliability.

#### The 5 Whys Technique
1. Start with the problem statement
2. Ask "Why did this happen?"
3. Take each answer and ask "Why?" again
4. Continue until reaching root cause
5. Verify the causal chain

#### Common Root Causes
- Configuration errors
- Resource constraints
- Code defects
- Environmental issues
- Infrastructure problems

### 3. Error Pattern Recognition

Recognizing common error patterns speeds up troubleshooting and resolution.

#### Pattern Categories
1. **Timing-Related**
   - Race conditions
   - Deadlocks
   - Resource contention

2. **Resource-Related**
   - Memory exhaustion
   - Connection pool depletion
   - Disk space issues

3. **Configuration-Related**
   - Environment mismatches
   - Invalid settings
   - Missing dependencies
