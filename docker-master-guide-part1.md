# Part 1: Foundation and Core Concepts

## Chapter 1: Docker Basics (The Container Ship Port)

### 1.1 Understanding Docker Architecture

#### Visual Memory Hook: "The Shipping Port"
```
                    Internet
                       ↑
                 Harbor Master
                 (Docker CLI)
                       ↑
                  The Harbor
               (Docker Engine)
                    ↗   ↖
               Ship1    Ship2
           (Container1) (Container2)
```

Think of Docker as a modern shipping port:
- Harbor Master (Docker CLI) = Gives commands
- The Harbor (Docker Engine) = Manages operations
- Ships (Containers) = Carry cargo (Applications)
- Cargo Plans (Images) = Blueprints for loading

#### Key Components Memory Trick: "DICE"
- **D**aemon (The Harbor Operations)
- **I**mages (The Ship Blueprints)
- **C**ontainers (The Active Ships)
- **E**ngine (The Whole System)

### 1.2 Practical Implementation

#### First Commands (Harbor Master's Orders)
```bash
# Check harbor status
docker info

# List all ships in port
docker ps

# View available blueprints
docker images
```

#### Memory Exercise 1.2.1: Your First Commands
Create a memorable sentence for each command:
- `docker info` = "**I**nspect the **n**earby **f**acilities **o**f the port"
- `docker ps` = "**P**ort **s**hips status check"
- `docker images` = "**I**nventory of ship **m**odels **a**vailable **g**lobally **e**verywhere **s**tored"

### 1.3 Hands-on Exercise: Launch Your First Container

#### The Story: "Your First Ship Launch"
Imagine you're a new harbor master launching your first ship. You need to:
1. Get a ship blueprint (image)
2. Launch the ship (container)
3. Verify it's sailing (running)
4. Send a test message (curl)

```bash
# Step 1: Get the blueprint
docker pull nginx
# Think: "Pulling the ship design from the catalog"

# Step 2: Launch the ship
docker run -d -p 80:80 --name my-first-ship nginx
# Think: "Launching ship named 'my-first-ship' at dock 80"

# Step 3: Check status
docker ps
# Think: "Port Status Check"

# Step 4: Send test signal
curl localhost:80
# Think: "Sending radio signal to ship at dock 80"
```

#### Exercise Solution Checklist
✓ Blueprint downloaded
✓ Container running
✓ Port accessible
✓ Web page visible

### 1.4 Understanding Container Lifecycle

#### Visual Memory Hook: "The Ship's Journey"
```
Created → Running → Paused → Stopped → Deleted
(Built)   (Sailing)  (Docked)  (Anchored) (Scrapped)
```

#### Lifecycle Commands Memory Trick: "STARS"
- **S**tart: Launch the ship
- **T**op: View crew (processes)
- **A**ttach: Board the ship
- **R**estart: Quick maintenance
- **S**top: End journey

#### Practice Exercise 1.4.1: Container Lifecycle
```bash
# Create container
docker create --name practice-ship nginx
# Think: "Building the ship"

# Start container
docker start practice-ship
# Think: "Setting sail"

# Pause container
docker pause practice-ship
# Think: "Temporary dock"

# Unpause container
docker unpause practice-ship
# Think: "Resume journey"

# Stop container
docker stop practice-ship
# Think: "Return to port"

# Remove container
docker rm practice-ship
# Think: "Ship recycling"
```

### 1.5 Docker Architecture Deep Dive

#### Visual Memory Hook: "The Port Control System"
```
Client Layer (Harbor Office)
       ↓
    REST API (Radio System)
       ↓
Docker Engine (Harbor Operations)
       ↓
containerd (Ship Controller)
       ↓
   runc (Ship Captain)
```

#### Memory Trick: "CLEAR" Architecture
- **C**lient sends commands
- **L**istens for responses
- **E**ngine processes requests
- **A**ction performed by containerd
- **R**unc executes container
