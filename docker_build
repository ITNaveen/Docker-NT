Shows:

Images: Docker images stored locally (like installed apps)

Total number of images
How many are actively used
Total disk space they occupy
How much space you could free up


Containers: Running or stopped containers

How many containers exist
How many are currently active
Extra space they use beyond their image size
Space that could be freed by removing stopped containers


Volumes: Persistent data storage

Number of volumes
How many are connected to containers
Space used by volume data
Space from unused volumes you could reclaim


Build Cache: Temporary files from building images

Cache entries from building images
Space used by build cache
How much cache space you could clean up



It's particularly useful when you need to:

Check how much disk space Docker is using
Find out if you need to clean up old resources
Identify what can be safely removed
Manage Docker disk usage efficiently
